# Expected indices are based on 4 PE's during an MPI run. If you change
# the number of PE is the ecbuild_add_test in the ../CMakeLists.txt file,
# then the expected indices below need to change accordingly.
#
# The test is coded so that the keyword "index" + (MPI Rank Number) is read from this
# file to get the expected result. If you are MPI rank 0, then you read "index0"
# from this file; MPI rank 1, read "index1"; etc.
