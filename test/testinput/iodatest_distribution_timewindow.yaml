# Expected indices are based on 4 PE's during an MPI run. If you change
# the number of PE in the ecbuild_add_test in the ../CMakeLists.txt file,
# then the expected indices below need to change accordingly.
#
# The test is coded so that the keyword "rank" + (MPI Rank Number) is used from this
# file to get the expected result. If you are MPI rank 0, then you read the keywords
# under "rank0:" from this file; MPI rank 1, keywords from "rank1:"; etc.
