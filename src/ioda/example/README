This directory contains example files for new observation operator implementation:

Observation space files:
ObsSpace.Example.interface.F90 -- Fortran functions on the interface between C++ and Fortran (called from ObsSpace.cc, calling functions in ufo_obs_example_mod.F90)
ioda_obs_example_mod.F90 -- Fortran module for observation space
Note: in some cases one may use already existing obsspace (different obs operators on the same data)

Other files that need to be updated when implementing new observation operator:
src/ufo/CMakeLists.txt: add files to makelist
src/ufo/Fortran.h: add definitions of Fortran routines called from C++ (the ones in the *.interface.F90 files, for example see radiosonde observation operator and obsspace definitions in Fortran.h)
src/ufo/ObsSpace.cc: add calls to your obsspace routines depending on your observation operator name (this a-bunch-of-ifs approach is to be fixed, it's temporary. In the future there will be separate ObsSpace classes for different obsspaces)
src/ufo/instantiateObsOperatorFactory.h: add instantiating of your observation operator (see examples there)
src/ufo/instantiateLinearObsOperatorFactory.h: same as above, for tl/ad.

Also, add tests (for nonlinear and tl/ad and for obsspace) for your observation operator.
